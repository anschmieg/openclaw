# ============================================================
# FORK MERGE STRATEGY
# ============================================================
# This fork uses custom merge drivers to automate upstream syncs.
# Git .gitattributes uses LAST-MATCH-WINS, so the default wildcard
# must come FIRST and specific overrides AFTER.
#
# OVERLAY FILES (merge=ours): Fork-only files that must NEVER be
# overwritten by upstream. Always keeps the fork's version.
#
# UNION-MERGE FILES (merge=union-gitignore): Files merged as a
# union of both sides.
#
# ALL OTHER FILES: merge=prefer-theirs auto-accepts upstream.
#
# To register the drivers, run: git-hooks/setup-merge-drivers.sh
# ============================================================

# --- Default: prefer upstream/theirs (MUST be first — last match wins) ---
* merge=prefer-theirs

# --- Overlay / fork-only files: always keep ours (overrides default) ---
