# ============================================================
# FORK MERGE STRATEGY
# ============================================================
# This fork uses custom merge drivers to automate upstream syncs.
#
# OVERLAY FILES (merge=ours): Fork-only files that must NEVER be
# overwritten by upstream. Always keeps the fork's version.
#
# UNION-MERGE FILES (merge=union-gitignore): Files that should be
# merged as a union of both sides (e.g., .gitignore).
#
# ALL OTHER FILES: Use merge=prefer-theirs to automatically accept
# upstream changes. This means upstream wins for any non-overlay file.
#
# To register the drivers, run: git-hooks/setup-merge-drivers.sh
# ============================================================
